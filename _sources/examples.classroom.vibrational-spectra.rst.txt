    # away from the pressure shifted line center.  The value at the cutoff frequency
    # is subsequently used to remove the value from within the line center.

    # some of its unknown or just difficult to model absorption features, however

    # quality of the absorption calculations, which can be seen by changing the
    # Y-scale of the absorption to logarithmic
